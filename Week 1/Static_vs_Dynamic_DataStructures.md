# Static and Dynamic data structures
Data structure is a way of storing and organising data efficiently such that the required operations on them can be performed efficiently with respect to time as well as memory. Simply, Data Structure is used to reduce complexity (mostly the time complexity) of the code.

Data structures can be two types:
* Static Data Structure
* Dynamic Data Structure

## Static Data structure
In the Static data structure, the size of the structure is fixed. The content of the data structure can be modified but without changing the memory space allocated to it.
