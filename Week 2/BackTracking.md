  Backtracking is the method of building the solution one piece at a time recursively and incrementally. The method keeps removing all those bits that do not contribute to the solution.
One such real-life example is a maze. At every dead end, you trace back your steps and set out for another path- thus setting a perfect example for backtracking. Similarly, Sudoku works on the same principle.
Thatâ€™s what backtracking is, retracing back the steps and discarding the choice that doesn't add on to build the correct solution.
